# FoodTruckProject


# Description
This program prompts users to input and rate a list of food trucks. It then allows the user to view the average rating and the highest-rated truck from an options menu.

# Program Criteria
## User Story 1
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array.

## User Story 2
If the user inputs quit for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.

## User Story 3
After input is complete, the user sees a second menu from which they can choose to:

* List all existing food trucks.
* See the average rating of food trucks.
* Display the highest-rated food truck.
* Quit the program.

## User Story 4
After a selected menu item finishes its action, the menu redisplays, allowing the user to select again, until the user selects the option to quit.

# Lessons Learned
This wasn't a particularly hard project regarding the logic and math needed to produce the correct answers/output. However, the hardest part of this project for me was writing the syntax correctly to ensure that objects and classes were created correctly and called correctly (along with arrays). Also, creating separate methods for everything created initial confusion for me just because it is something that I don't have as much practice in.
